# Clean Architecture Guidelines

## Architectural Decision Guidance

### Why CQRS for Delegation Service
- **Different performance characteristics**: Data collection (write) vs API serving (read) have different optimization needs
- **Independent scaling**: Scraper can be optimized for throughput, API for latency
- **Fault isolation**: External API failures don't affect read queries
- **Clear boundaries**: Write and read concerns are naturally separated

### Why Separate Read and Write Services
- **Operational independence**: Services can be deployed, scaled, and managed independently
- **Technology choices**: Each service can use different databases, frameworks, or patterns
- **Team boundaries**: Different teams can own different services
- **Failure isolation**: Problems in one service don't cascade to the other

### When to Use Interfaces
- **External dependencies**: When you need to mock or swap implementations for testing
- **Future flexibility**: When you anticipate changing implementations (databases, APIs)
- **Testing isolation**: When you need to unit test without external dependencies
- **Avoid over-abstraction**: Don't create interfaces for internal components that won't change

### When to Keep Domain Models Pure
- **Business logic belongs in domain**: Validation, formatting, business rules
- **External concerns don't belong in domain**: HTTP, database, JSON tags
- **Testability**: Pure domain models are easier to unit test
- **Reusability**: Domain models can be used across different layers

### When to Apply Clean Architecture Patterns
- **Medium to large projects**: Where complexity justifies the abstraction overhead
- **Multiple external dependencies**: Databases, APIs, message queues
- **Long-term maintenance**: When code will be maintained by multiple people over time
- **Avoid for simple CRUD**: Don't over-engineer basic data access patterns

### Architecture Decision Framework
- **Start simple**: Begin with straightforward solutions, add complexity when needed
- **Measure before optimizing**: Profile and benchmark before making performance assumptions
- **Consider team size**: More abstraction for larger teams, simpler for smaller teams
- **Think about change**: What's likely to change? What needs to stay stable?
- **Balance abstractions**: Some coupling is acceptable for simplicity

## Design Decisions
- **Go workspace monorepo** - Uber-style multi-module setup with independent service modules
- **CQRS pattern** - Clear separation between read (web) and write (scraper) operations  
- **Independent modules** - Each service is a separate Go module for true service boundaries
- **Coordinated development** - `go.work` enables local development across all modules
- **Professional tooling** - Self-documenting Makefile with colored output and awk-based help
- **Standard naming** - `pkg/` for shared libraries/utilities following Go ecosystem conventions
- **Service isolation** - Domain models stay within each service to maintain clear boundaries
- **Screaming architecture** - Structure makes the system purpose immediately obvious
- **Domain-driven naming** - Use business terms (poller, finder, recorder) over technical terms

## Production Notes
- In production, these would be separate microservices with independent deployments
- Each service would have its own repository and configuration  
- Go workspace structure demonstrates how modules can be independently versioned and deployed
- Initially sharing a database, then evolving to event-driven architecture with separate databases
- The `pkg/` module would become separate published library modules or duplicated minimal utilities
- Standard HTTP handlers initially, with OpenAPI generation added for API documentation and client generation
- Makefile demonstrates professional build tooling that scales to CI/CD pipelines
