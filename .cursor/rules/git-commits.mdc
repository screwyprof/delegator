# Git Commit Guidelines

## Conventional Commits Format
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples
```
feat: add delegation endpoint with pagination

Implements GET /xtz/delegations with year filtering and 50-item pagination.
Response format matches specification with timestamp, amount, delegator, and level fields.

feat: implement Tzkt API client for delegation polling

BREAKING CHANGE: The `-x` flag was removed.
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, etc.

## Commit Process
- When user says "let's commit" or similar:
  - **Only propose the commit message**
  - **Do not execute any git commands**
  - **Let the user handle the actual commit**

## Best Practices
- Use imperative mood in the subject line
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
