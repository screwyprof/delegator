# Project Context

## Project Structure
- Go workspace with multiple modules: root, pkg/, scraper/, web/
- Each module has its own go.mod file
- Use `go work sync` instead of manual `go mod tidy` in subdirectories
- CQRS pattern: Scraper (write) and Web API (read)

## Workspace Commands
- Use `go work sync` for workspace dependency management
- Single `./...` works for workspace-wide operations
- Avoid manual `go mod tidy` in individual module directories

## Module Organization
- Keep modules focused and loosely coupled
- Shared code in pkg/ module
- Service-specific logic in dedicated modules (scraper/, web/)

## Dependencies
- Prefer standard library where possible
- Use slog for structured logging
- Use testify for testing assertions
- Minimize external dependencies
