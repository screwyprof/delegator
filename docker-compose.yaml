      # DEVELOPMENT DEMO CONFIGURATION - Uses tmpfs for fast iterations
      # 
      # This configuration is INTENTIONALLY optimized for development demo speed:
      # - Fresh database on every restart for consistent demo experience
      # - In-memory storage makes tests and demos extremely fast
      # - Shows system processing full Tezos history (760k+ delegations) in ~0.06s
      #
      # PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT would use persistent storage:
      # - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  (persistent volume)
      # - Remove performance optimizations (fsync=off, etc.)
      # - Add proper backup and monitoring
